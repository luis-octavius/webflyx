This project was made in the course 'Learn Git' in [Boot.dev](boot.dev). 

The idea was to learn and improve some concepts of Git tecnology:
- Understand what a commit is
- How to get the contents of a commit with his hash
- How to amend and squash commits
- How to use `rebase`
- How to `git reset` appropriately
- How to merge and pull request
